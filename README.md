# OSFiler - OSINT Profiling Tool

OSFiler is an educational Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) profiling tool that helps researchers create comprehensive profiles of subjects (people, organizations, etc.) by collecting and linking various data points through a graph-based approach.

- **Graph Visualization**: Visual representation of nodes and relationships using vis.js
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend functionality with new modules
- **Data Persistence**: Save investigations in PostgreSQL database
- **Authentication**: Secure access to your investigations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Python

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development in Progress** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is currently under heavily active development. Features may be incomplete or subject to change.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Python (v3.12+)
- PostgreSQL (v13+)

## Installation

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnlyOneCookie/osfiler.git
cd osfiler
```

2. **Set up the backend**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

3. **Set up the frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL**

- Install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- Create a new database
- Update the database configuration in backend/core/config.py

## Usage

1. **Login**
   - Default development credentials: admin/admin

2. **Create Investigation**
   - Create a new investigation with a title and description
   - Add a main node representing your investigation subject

3. **Add Nodes**
   - Add various node types (email, username, phone, etc.)
   - Connect nodes to create relationships

4. **Use Modules**
   - Run the Username Search module to find accounts across platforms
   - Add discovered accounts to your investigation

5. **Visualize**
   - Use the graph view to visualize connections
   - Manipulate the graph to organize your data

## Module Development

OSFiler is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy extension. To create your own module:

1. Create a new Python file in the `backend/modules/addons` directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `email_analyzer.py`)
2. Implement the module interface by extending the `BaseModule` class
3. The module will be automatically discovered and loaded by the ModuleRunner

For example:
```python
# backend/modules/addons/example_module.py
from backend.modules.base import BaseModule

class ExampleModule(BaseModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "example_module"
        self.description = "Example module for OSFiler"
        # ... other configuration ...
    
    def execute(self, params):
        # Implementation goes here
        return {"status": "success"}
```

Detailed module development documentation can be found in the [Module Development Guide](docs/modules.md).
