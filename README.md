OSFiler is an educational Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) profiling tool that helps researchers create comprehensive profiles of subjects (people, organizations, etc.) by collecting and linking various data points through a graph-based approach.

## üîç What is OSINT?

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources. It's a crucial skill in various fields including:

- Cybersecurity research and threat intelligence
- Digital forensics and investigations
- Business intelligence and competitive analysis
- Academic research and journalism
- Law enforcement and security operations

OSFiler is designed to help researchers and investigators organize and visualize OSINT data in a structured, graph-based format, making it easier to identify patterns and connections between different pieces of information.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üìä Graph-Based Visualization**: Create and visualize connections between different data points using an intuitive graph interface
* **üîç Comprehensive Node System**: Support for various node types including persons, organizations, usernames, emails, phone numbers, and more
* **üîÑ Modular Design**: Extend functionality with custom modules for different OSINT capabilities
* **üíæ Data Persistence**: Save and manage investigations in a PostgreSQL database
* **üîí Secure Access**: Authentication system to protect your investigations
* **üì± Modern Interface**: Clean, responsive UI built with React and TypeScript

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

OSFiler consists of multiple components working together:

| Component | Description | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Frontend  | Web-based user interface | React, TypeScript |
| Backend   | API and business logic | Python, FastAPI |
| Database  | Data storage | PostgreSQL |
| Modules   | Extensible OSINT capabilities | Python |

For detailed architecture information, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).
